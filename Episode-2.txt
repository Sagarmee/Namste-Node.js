1 - what is server ?
Ans - Server is a computer or machine which is located remotely.
      Server is provide resources to the client over network.

javascript is only run on web-browser so js is use for client side development. but if developer want to communicate with server or fetching the resource from the server they 
need different programing language to communicate with server,but node.js gives functionality to run javascript on server.so now js can be use for client-side and server-side programing.
js now can run outside of the web-browser. 

with the help of node.js developer dont't need to learn both language for front-end and back-end.

2 - What is V8?
Ans - V8 is javascript engine which is run on chrome. v8 written in c++ application, V8 can be embedded into any C++ application.

The process works as follows: JavaScript code is executed by V8 (written in C++), which then compiles it down to machine code that the computer can execute.
v8 engine, spider monkey, and other browser enginer follows Ecmascript standards.

so , v8 engines has to follow this ECMA standards. and node.js has v8
engines, but node.js also has some superpowers, such as api calls on servers,
which make it more powerful than v8 engines alone, which cannot do
database connections, api calls, etc. because of ECMA standards. and this is
known as the JS runtime.


3 - What is Ecmascript
Ans - Ecmascript is standards or rules for javascript which is defined by particular community. 


NODEJS is a c++ application with v8 embedded into it



--> Undestand How computer undestand the javascript. 


- On the top of we code into js and v8 engine excute that code. v8 engine is written in c++ which is convert into machine code and low-level langaguge and then
assembler convert that low level into binary code and understand the computer.
